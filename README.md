Compare Changes in CivitAI Terms of Service Using Git Tags

Since official change logs are not provided, this repository uses Git to track and compare revisions of the CivitAI Terms of Service.

The easiest way to view differences between versions is by comparing tags, as each revision is stored in a separate branch.

To compare two versions:
1. Visit: https://github.com/ARZUMATA/CivitAI_Tos_Changes/compare/main...main?expand=1
2. Select the tags you want to compare using the dropdown menus.
3. Click "Compare" to view the differences.

This will open a pull request draft showing the file changes between the selected tags. You do not need to create a pull request â€” simply use the comparison view to inspect the differences.
